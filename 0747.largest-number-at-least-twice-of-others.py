#
# In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.
# 
# Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as
# every other number in the array.
# 
# If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the
# array x,
# 6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return
# 1.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return
# -1.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# nums will have a length in the range [1, 50].
# Every nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 99].
