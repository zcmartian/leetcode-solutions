 * Hard (26.02%)
 * Total Accepted:    82.4K
 * Total Submissions: 316.7K
 * Testcase Example:  '2\n[2,4,1]'
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given
 * stock on day i.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k
 * transactions.
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must
 * sell the stock before you buy again).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit
 * = 4-2 = 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit
 * = 6-2 = 4.
 * Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 =
 * 3.
