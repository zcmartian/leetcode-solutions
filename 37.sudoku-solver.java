 * Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
 * 
 * A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
 * 
 * 
 * Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
 * Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
 * Each of the the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3
 * sub-boxes of the grid.
 * 
 * 
 * Empty cells are indicated by the character '.'.
 * 
 * 
 * A sudoku puzzle...
 * 
 * 
 * ...and its solution numbers marked in red.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
 * You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique
 * solution.
 * The given board size is always 9x9.
