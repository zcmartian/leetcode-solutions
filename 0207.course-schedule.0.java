 * Total Submissions: 533.2K
 * Testcase Example:  '2\n[[1,0]]'
 *
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
 * 
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have
 * to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * 
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it
 * possible for you to finish all courses?
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you
 * should
 * also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not
 * adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input
 * prerequisites.
