 * Total Submissions: 182.5K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,1,3,2,5]'
 *
 * Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only
 * once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements
 * that appear only once.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
 * Output: [3,5]
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is
 * also correct.
 * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
 * it using only constant space complexity?
